## Introduction 

"Hello, World!" program:

    (write "Hello, World!")

The program text above when run in the REPL should print the famous

    "Hello, World!"

followed by the result

    ==> t

and the prompt `JMurmel>`.


## Disclaimer 

In order to understand and make use of this Reference Manual
one should probably at least know some Lisp.
This manual does not attempt to be a Lisp or Murmel tutorial.


## Terminology 

### S-expressions vs. forms
Murmel is a Lisp dialect. As such the language isn't
really defined in terms of program text but in terms
of in-memory objects (lists, symbols and other atoms)
that are acceptable to eval.

That said, JMurmel's default reader turns S-expressions
from the input stream into equivalent in-memory objects. So
for this reference we'll use S-expressions to describe
programs that are valid Murmel, i.e. are acceptable to `eval`.

In this reference in-memory objects that are valid Murmel
(as well as their textual representation as S-expressions)
are referred to as "forms".

### Surface representation vs. internal representation
This is really the same discussion as "S-expressions vs. forms".
JMurmel adds S-Expressions as a surface representation
to Murmel.



## S-expressions 

The following are S-expressions that JMurmel's reader
will accept and transform into in-memory objects.
Valid S-expressions may or may not be "forms" (eval w/o error),
see "Terminology" for a discussion of form vs. S-expressions.

### Atoms that are not symbols

    1
    1.0
    "a string"


### Atoms that are symbols

    a-symbol
    |a symbol|
    a\ symbol


A single quote is a shorthand for (quote an-expression)

    'an-expression

A dotted pair

    '(a . b)              ; ==> (a . b)

A dotted list

    '(a . (b . (c . d)))  ; ==> (a . (b . (c . d)))

Shorthand for dotted list

    '(a b c . d)          ; ==> (a b c . d)

A proper list

    '(a . (b . (c . ()))) ; ==> (a b c)

Shorthand for a proper list

    '(a b c)              ; ==> (a b c)

Backquote "\`" starts "fill-in templates":
backquote, comma and comma-at work similar to CL,
except: comma-dot is not supported.

    (define a 'a-val) (define b 'b-val) (define c 'c-val)
    (define d '(d-val1 d-val2))
    `((,a b) ,c ,@d)      ; ==> ((a-val b) c-val d-val1 d-val2)

    (define y 'b) (define l '(a b))
    (eval ``(,a ,,@l ,,y)) ; ==> (a-val a-val b-val b-val)

    (define x '(1 2 3))
    `(normal= ,x splicing= ,@x see?) ; ==> (normal= (1 2 3) splicing= 1 2 3 see?)

    `(normal= ,x fakesplicing= . ,x) ; ==> (normal= (1 2 3) fakesplicing= 1 2 3)

One line comments are started with ';', i.e. everything between a semicolon
and the end of the line is ignored:

    ; this is a comment

Multiline comments are started with '#|' and end with '|#':

    #|
    This is a
    multiline comment.
    |#


## Predefined Symbols 

"nil" and "t" are pre-defined self-evaluating symbols

    nil
    t

"dynamic" is a pre-defined self-evaluating symbol that may be used
in the `(lambda dynamic...` and `(let* dynamic...` forms, see below.

    dynamic

`internal-time-units-per-second` contains the resolution
of the time related functions, see below.

    internal-time-units-per-second

`pi` contains the value of the mathematical constant pi
in double precision.

    pi


## Basic Special Forms 

### (quote form) -> form

quote returns a form w/o evaluating it

    (quote a-symbol) ; ==> a-symbol

### (lambda (params...) forms...) -> closure

When a lambda is created by the special form "lambda"
the lexical environment is captured at the time of lambda creation.

Arguments to the special form "lambda" are not evaluated.

    (lambda (p1 p2) p1)

lambda with varargs:
If paramlist is a symbol then all arguments will be
packed into a list and bound to the symbol.
If paramlist is a dotted list then remaining arguments
will be bound to the last parameter.
The list containing optional arguments is immutable,
i.e. using rplaca and rplacd is undefined behaviour.

    (lambda popt (write popt)) ; no mandatory arguments
    (lambda (p1 p2 . prest) (write prest)) ; two mandatory arguments


## Data types 

Murmel supports symbols and lists as well as other atoms
that are not symbols.

These other atoms are double precision floating point numbers,
64bit integer numbers, strings and characters. Custom primitives
may support additional atoms.

A symbol. Murmel treats symbols case-insensitive.
Symbol names are of arbitrary length, however only the
first 30 chars are significant.

Implementation note: JMurmel preserves the
capitalization of the first encounter of a symbol
for printing, e.g.:

    '(AbC . dEf) -> (AbC . dEf)

but

    '(AbC . abc) -> (AbC . AbC)

    '*a-sample-symbol*
    'a\ symbol\ with\ spaces!

Empty list, printed as "nil"

    ()

Shorthand for empty list

    nil

an integer number

tokens that consist of a sign or digit followed by digits
are interpreted as 64bit integer numbers (java.lang.Long)

    1

Datatype float: a number in double precision

numbers that contain the characters '.eE' are interpreted
as double precision (java.lang.Double)

    1.

a float in scientific notation

    1e3

Stringliterals may have a maximum length of 2000 chars.
Stringliterals of the same value are coalesced (interned).

    "a string literal"
    "another 'literal' \"string literal\""


## NIL and T 

Murmel treats the symbols NIL and T the same way
as Mr. Moon specified them in a Memo (see "The Evolution
of Lisp pp 62"):

"NIL is a symbol, the empty list, and the distinguished
"false" value. SYMBOLP, ATOM, and LISTP are true of it;
CONSP is not. CAR, CDR, and EVAL of NIL are NIL.
NIL may not be used as a function, nor as a variable."

"T is a symbol and the default "true" value used by predicates that
are not semi-predicates (i.e., that donâ€™t return "meaningful" values
when they are true.) EVAL of T is T. T may not be used as a variable.
T is a keyword recognized by certain functions, such as FORMAT."


## Reserved words 

In addition to NIL and T some symbols are reserved, i.e.
may not be used as a function nor as a variable:

    nil, t,
    lambda, quote, cond, labels, if, define, defun, let, let*, letrec,
    setq, apply, progn, defmacro


## Variables and Scope 

Symbols are bound to global variables using `define` or `defun`
(see below), and to local variables using `let, let*, letrec` or
lambda parameter lists.

Murmel's global bindings are lexical and must be defined before use,
i.e. a symbol is bound to
a newly created variable when define or defun are actually executed.
The symbol's binding as well as the variable's extent (lifetime)
last to the end of the program (the symbol's binding may be
temporarily replaced by a local or dynamic binding, though).

Murmel's local bindings are lexical, i.e. a symbol is bound to
a newly created variable when a let/let*/letrec/lambda form
is executed. The symbol's binding as well as the associated variable
are removed when leaving the lexical scope of the `let/let*/letrec/lambda`
form, restoring any previously existing binding (which may have
been local or global).
Except: `let* dynamic` will treat global symbols as "special", see below.


## Additional Special Forms 

### (define symbol object) -> symbol

define binds symbols in the global environment with
memory locations that hold values.
Murmel's define is somewhat similar to Common Lisp's defparameter
except:

CL's defparameter creates special global variables while
Murmel's define creates global variables that can be
lexically hidden by e.g. a let-binding.

The first argument is not evaluated, the second one is.

    (define *global-var* 42)               ; ==> *gloval-var*
    (define f1 (lambda (p1 p2) (+ p1 p2))) ; ==> f1

### (defun symbol (params...) forms...) -> symbol

defun is a shorthand for defining functions
    (defun symbol (params...) forms...)
       <=>
    (define symbol (lambda (params...) forms...))
arguments to defun are not evaluated

    (defun f2 (p1 p2) (+ p1 p2)) ; ==> f2

### (defmacro name (params...) forms...) -> symbol<br/>(defmacro name) -> prev-name

Defines a macro, similar to CL's defmacro.
Macros are somewhat similar to functions:
On a function application the functions's arguments
are eval'd and the result of the function will be used as is.
On a macro application the macro's arguments are
NOT eval'd, but the result of the macro is.

IOW a function produces a value, a macro application
produces code that will be eval'd.
Macros are defined in a macro namespace.
All macros are in the global scope, i.e. macros
are not scoped but once defined they are visible everywhere.

`(defmacro name)` can be used to unbind previously
defined macros.

    (defmacro twice (arg) (list '* arg 2))  ; ==> twice
    (twice 3) ; ==> 6.0
    (defmacro twice) ; ==> twice; macro is unbound
    (defmacro twice) ; ==> nil

### (setq symbol value...) -> last-value

Updates the value of the given global or local symbols which must be already defined.

    (define a nil)
    (let ((b nil) (c nil))
      (setq a 1 b 2 c (+ a b))) ; ==> 3.0

### (if condform form optionalform) -> object

    (if nil 'YASSS! 'OHNOOO!!!) ; ==> OHNOOO!!!

### (progn expr...) -> object

    (if t (progn (write 'abc) (write 'def)))

### (cond (condform forms...)... ) -> object

### (labels ((symbol (params...) forms...)...) forms...) -> object


### (let optsymbol? ((symbol bindingform)...) bodyforms...) -> object

Works similar to CL's "let" with the addition
of Scheme's "named let".
The let-bound variables "symbol" as well as "optsymbol" - if given -
are bound inside bodyforms.
"optsymbol" will be bound inside "bodyforms" to a lambda
whose parameters are the let-variables and whose code is
"bodyforms". Therefore "optsymbol" can be used for
recursive calls within "bodyforms".

    (let loop ((x 3)
               (msg "hi"))
      (if (= x 0)
          (write msg)
        (progn (write (floor x)) (loop (- x 1) msg))))

### (let* dynamic ((symbol bindingform)...) bodyforms...) -> object

Similar to "let" except: globals are not shadowed but temporarily
bound to the given value, and the previous value is restored when
leaving the scope of the let form.
I.e. "let* dynamic" treats globals as "special".

    (define *g* 'global)
    (defun f () (write *g*))
    (let* dynamic ((*g* 'temp)) (f)) ; f will write temp
    *g* ; ==> 'global

### (let* optsymbol? ((symbol bindingform)...) bodyforms...) -> object

Works like let (see above) with the addition:
each bindingform "sees" the previous symbols. If multiple
let-bindings use the same symbol the last one hides
preceeding ones.

    (let* loop ((y 10)
                (x (+ y 20))
                (x (floor (/ x 10)))
                (msg 'hi))
      (if (= x 0)
          (write msg)
        (progn (write (floor x)) (loop 0 0 (- x 1) msg))))

### (letrec ((symbol bindingform)...) bodyforms...) -> object

`letrec` works like `let` and `let*` except each bindingform "sees"
all other let symbols as well as it's own symbol.
All symbols are bound, but only the preceeding bindings
are defined (have a value) while eval'ing the `bindingform`.
That way a let-bound variable could be a recursive lambda.

    (letrec ((x 1) (y (+ x 1))) (write y))

### (apply form argform) -> object

`form` must return a primitive or lambda.
`argform` must eval to a proper list. 

    (apply + '(1 2)) ; ==> 3.0

### (load filespec) -> object

Eval the contents of the given file, return value
is the value returned by the last form or nil
in case of an empty file.

When compiling Murmel "load" is performed at
compile time.

"filespec" is not eval'd and must be a string.
Unless filespec ends with ".lisp" the file extension
".lisp" will be appended.
If filespec is an absolute path then it will be used as is.
Otherwise the file will be searched in the same directory
as the file that contains the "load" and after that
in "libdir" (set with --libdir, libdir defaults to the
directory containing jmurmel.jar).
If "load" is entered into the REPL then the file
will be searched in the current directory and then
in the directory that contains jmurmel.jar.

    (load "nul") ; ==> nil, NUL is Windows specific
    (load "lib") ; will search for lib.lisp


### (require module-name optional-file-path)

Load the given file once. Murmel maintains an internal
set of loaded modules, and "require" will ignore
loading files that were already loaded by comparing
"module-name" to the set of already loaded modules.

When compiling Murmel "require" is performed at
compile time.

If "optional-file-path" is omitted or nil then
"module-name" will be used as the file path.

"module-name" and "optional-file-path" are not eval'd
and must be strings.

    (require "mlib") ; will search for the file mlib.lisp
                     ; unless the module "mlib" was already loaded


## Function application 

### function call

Applies the operator returned by operatorform to
the eval'd operands

    (operatorform operands...)


## Predefined Primitives 

### (cons e1 e2) -> conscell

    (cons 'a 'b) ; ==> (a . b)

### (car list) -> 1st element of list

    (car '(a b c)) ; ==> a
    (car "abc") ; ==> #\a

### (cdr list) -> rest of list

    (cdr '(a b c)) ; ==> (b c)
    (cdr "abc") ; ==> "bc"

### rplaca, rplacd

Replace the value of the CAR or CDR slot of a cons cell.

    (define l '(1 2))
    (rplaca l 11) ; ==> (11 2)
    (rplacd l 22) ; ==> (11 . 22)

### (eval form) -> object<br/> (eval form env) -> object

"form" will be eval'd, it must return a form.
The optional argument "env" will be eval'd, it must return a list of (symbol . value).
If the optional argument "env" is omitted or nil
then the environment for the recursive eval is "all predefined global symbols"
else it is the concatenation of "env" and all predefined globals

    (eval '(+ 1 2)) ; ==> 3.0
    (eval '(+ x y) (list '(x . 2) '(y . 3))) ; ==> 5.0
    (eval '(+ x y) (list (cons 'x 2) (cons 'y 3))) ; ==> 5.0

### (eq x y) -> boolean

Returns t if x and y are the same object, nil otherwise.

(eql x y) -> boolean

Return t if any of the following is true

- a and b are eq
- a and b are numbers of the same type and have the same value
- a and b are the same characters

    (eql 2 2) ; => t
    (eql #\a (car "aaa") ; => t
    (eql -0.0 0.0) ; => nil

### null, atom, consp, listp, symbolp, numberp, integerp, floatp, stringp, characterp

### (assoc key alist) -> cons or nil

assoc takes a key and a list of key/value tupels (lists or conses).
The return value is the first cons whose car is equal(*) to "key"
or nil if no such cons was found. nil-elements in "alist" are ignored.

(*) assoc compares two items as if eql was used.
    assoc considers two items as "equal" if

- Both are "eq" (are the same object)
- Both are integers or floats or characters respectively and have the same value

Examples:

    (assoc 'a-key '((key-1 1) (key-2 2) (a-key 3) (key-4 4))) ; ==> (a-key 3)
    (cdr (assoc 'a-key '((key-1 . 1) (key-2 . 2) (a-key . 3) (key-4 . 4)))) ; ==> 3
    (assoc nil '((key-1 1) nil (nil 2) (a-key 3) (key-4 4))) ==> (nil 2)

### (append lists...) -> list

append nondestructively append it's arguments. All arguments except the last
are shallow copied, all arguments except the last must be lists.

    (append)                    ; ==> nil
    (append 'a)                 ; ==> a
    (append '(a b) 'c)          ; ==> (a b . c)
    (append '(a b) '(c d))      ; ==> (a b c d)
    (append '(a . b) '(c d))    ; ==> (a b c d)
    (append '(a . b) '(c . d))  ; ==> (a b c . d)

### +, -, *, /, mod, rem, sqrt, log, log10, exp, expt

The math operators accept numbers only, log only takes 1 argument,
but otherwise should work similar to CL.
All numeric operators return a double.
eg. (+ number number) -> double

    (+ 1 1) ; ==> 2.0

### 1+, 1-

Increment and decrement return the same type as the argument.

    (1+ 1)   ; ==> 2
    (1+ 1.0) ; ==> 2.0

### round, truncate, floor, ceiling

These functions take one argument and return an integer value or an exception
if the value cannot be represented by a long
(NaN, Infinite, integer overflow or underflow),
eg. (floor number) -> long

    (floor 1.1) ; ==> 1

### fround, ftruncate, ffloor, fceiling

These functions take one argument and return an integer value as a double,
eg. (ffloor number) -> double

    (ffloor 1.1) ; ==> 1.0

### (signum number) -> signed-prototype

signum determines a numerical value that indicates whether
number is negative, zero, or positive. 

    (signum 0)    ; => 0
    (signum -0)   ; => 0
    (signum 3)    ; => 1
    (signum -3)   ; => -1

    (signum 0.0)  ; => 0.0
    (signum -0.0) ; => -0.0
    (signum 3.0)  ; => 1.0
    (signum -3.0) ; => -1.0

### = < > <= >= /=

The numeric comparison operators take one or more number arguments.

    (= 1 1.0)         ; ==> t
    (< 1 2 3.0 4 5.0) ; ==> t
    (< 1 2 3 3 4 5)   ; ==> nil

### (macroexpand-1 quoted-form) -> expanded form

macroexpand-1 is a simplified version of CL's macroexpand-1.
It is only supported in interpreted code.
If the operator of the list "quoted-form" is a macroname then
the macrocall will be expanded, e.g.:

    (defmacro add2 (a) `(+ ,a 2))  ; ==> add2
    (macroexpand-1 '(add2 3))      ; ==> (+ 3 2)

### (gensym) -> uninterned symbol

    (gensym)

### read, write, writeln, lnwrite

Both expressions as well as data are read from stdin.
The following expression reads the expression immediately following it
(in this case the expression to be read is the string "Hello!").

    (write (read)) "Hello!"

writeln and lnwrite accept one optional argument
writeln will write the argument if given and non-nil, followed by a newline
lnwrite will write a newline followed by the argument if given and non-nil,
followed by a ' ', i.e. writeln is C-style, lnwrite is Lisp-style.

    (writeln "Hello, ")
    (writeln)
    (writeln "World!")

### (get-internal-real-time) -> number

Walltime in internal time units, relative to an arbitrary time base

    (get-internal-real-time)

### (get-run-real-time) -> number

User cpu time in internal time units

    (get-internal-run-time)

### (get-internal-cpu-time) -> number

User + system cpu time in internal time units

    (get-internal-cpu-time)

### (sleep desired-duration) -> actual-duration

Pause execution for x internal time units, returns actually slept
wall time in internal time units as an integer (java.lang.Long).
This example code will pause execution for approx. 1 second.

    (sleep (* 1 internal-time-units-per-second))

### (get-universal-time) -> seconds since 1.1.1900 00:00:00 UTC

This example code will return approx. years since 1.1.1900

    (/ (get-universal-time) 60 60 24 365)

### (get-decoded-time) -> second, minute, hour, date, month, year, day, daylight-p, zone

NOTE: In Common Lisp zone is given as a a rational multiple of 1/3600 of hours
      offset from Greenwich Mean Time.
      In Murmel zone is given as a double, e.g. Vienna in winter is -1.0.
      The result type of Murmel's (get-decoded-time) is a list
      while CL's returns an ordered sequence.

    (get-decoded-time)

### format, format-locale

format t writes a formatted string to stdout and returns nil.
format's parameters work as java.lang.String.format().

    (format t "a string: %s, a number: %g, a newline:%n" "The String" 3.14)

format-locale works similar to format except it has an additional
first string parameter that should be a locale, nil means use Java's
default locale.

    (format-locale t
       "de-DE" "a string: %s, a number: %g, a newline:%n" "The String" 3.14)

format nil and format-locale nil work similar
to format and format-locale except they don't write to stdout
but return the string

    (format-locale nil
       "de-DE" "a string: %s, a number: %g, a newline:%n" "The String" 3.14)

### (code-char integer) -> character

### (char-code character) -> integer

### (string= s1 s2) -> boolean

### (string->list str) -> list-of-characters

### (list->string list-of-characters) -> string


## Predefined Graphics Primitives 

Murmel features primitives for graphics output to a frame.

A frame is a toplevel GUI window with a title. One can write text on a frame,
and/ or draw lines with Turtle graphics or moveto/lineto functions.
Also one can attach a bitmap to a frame and use pixel-graphics primitives.

0/0 is towards left bottom, any drawing will be resized/ shifted so that
it fills the frame.

A frame has state: open/closed, current x/y position, current linecolor,
current turtle angle and background color.

One can use several frames but only one is the "current-frame". All functions
(except make-frame) have an optional last parameter "frame" that can be used
to select which frame to operate on (if omitted or `nil` then the current frame is used).

Hint: if graphics primitives are slow then maybe switching to OpenGL
will speed things up:

    C:\> java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true -jar jmurmel.jar

Colors are 0..15 corresponding to

      0 ; white
      1 ; black
      2 ; red
      3 ; green
      4 ; blue
      5 ; pink
      6 ; orange
      7 ; yellow
      8 ; magenta
      9 ; cyan
     10 ; darkGray
     11 ; gray
     12 ; lightGray
     13 ; darkred
     14 ; darkgreen
     15 ; darkblue

### (make-frame window-title optwidthpixels optheightpixels optpaddingpixels) -> frame

Creates a new frame, sets current frame.
If width and height are omitted or nil then half of the physical screen
width/ height will be used.
If padding is omitted or nil then 40 will be used.
The newly created frame will not yet be visible (see open-frame below).

    (let ((window-title "test") (optwidthpixels 100) (optheightpixels 100) (optpaddingpixels 10))
      (make-frame window-title optwidthpixels optheightpixels optpaddingpixels)) ; ==> frame

### (current-frame) -> frame

Returns current frame.

### (current-frame optional-frame) -> frame

Set new current frame, returns previous current frame.

### More frame-functions

open-frame ... make frame visible  
close-frame ... hide frame  
reset-frame ... reset pen to "down", turtle position and angle, color and bgcolor    
clear-frame ... reset frame and discard frame contents  
repaint-frame ... force full repaint  
flush-frame ... paint operations won't take immediate effect, flush-frame makes them visible  
pen-up ... subsequent line operations will only move the position
pen-down ... subsequent line operations will have visible effect
push-pos ... save current position and angle
pop-pos ... restore previous position and angle

The above functions all take one optional frame parameter. If omitted or nil
then the current frame will be used.

### (color color optional-frame) -> frame

Set color for following lines, color must be >= 0 and <= 12

    (color 1) ; ==> frame

### (bgcolor color optional-frame) -> frame

Set background color for frame, color must be >= 0 and <= 12

    (bgcolor 0) ; ==> frame

### (text str optional-frame) -> frame

Writes str at current position, does not change position.

### (left  deg optional-frame) -> frame</br>(right deg optional-frame) -> frame

Increase/ decrease current angle by "deg" degrees, does not change position.

### (forward len optional-frame) -> frame

If pen is down then this function paints a line of length "len" from current
position in current direction, changes position.
If pen is up then only the position is changed.

### move-to, line-to, move-rel, line-rel

These functions take two arguments denoting the new position
and an optional frame argument.

    (define new-x 1)
    (define new-y 2)
    (define optional-frame nil)
    (line-rel new-x new-y optional-frame) ; ==> frame

### (make-bitmap w h optional-frame) -> frame

Associates a bitmap of the given width and height
with the current or given frame. The bitmap will be scaled
to fill the frame.

### (discard-bitmap optional-frame)

Remove the bitmap of the given or current frame,
and release the resources associated with the bitmap.

### (rgb-to-pixel r g b) -> 24bit color value acceptable to set-pixel

r, g and b are 0..255

### (hsb-to-pixel h s b) ; -> 24bit color value acceptable to set-pixel

h, s and b are 0..1.0

### (set-pixel x y color-as-24-bit optional-frame) -> frame

Set pixel at the given xy-position to the given color.

## Extensions 

JMurmel adds some extra features to Murmel which are listed below.

### lambda dynamic

For experimentation purposes the interpreter also supports
lambdas that are not lexical closures.

When the optional keyword "dynamic" is given then
no environment is captured, and lambdas - when applied -
get the dynamic environment.

    (lambda dynamic (params...) forms...) -> anonymous function with
                                             dynamic environment

### Custom primitives

In embedded use primitives may be added, also Java methods
created by the primitive `::` (see below) act as builtins.
As far as the language is concerned, all primitives are variadic functions.
The primitives themselves may have parameter checks, tough.
In case they are called with the wrong type(s) or number of parameters
the primitives may throw an error.

### Language subsets

JMurmel supports commandline parameters that can be used to
disable many of Murmel's forms, predefined variables, ... .
These commandline parameters can be used to experiment
with an even more reduced Lisp.

See 'jmurmel --help-features'


## Additional JMurmel special forms and primitives 

### (trace function-name*) -> trace-result<br/> (untrace function-name*) -> untrace-result

Arguments to trace/ untrace are eval'd.
In interpreted code these work similar to CL's trace/ untrace macros,
see http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_tracec.htm.
Only interpreted code will be traced (user code as well as
interpreter primities).

    (trace 'write '+)  
    (write (+ 1 2))  
    (untrace)

### (:: classname methodname paramclass...) -> primitive

The primitive "::" will return a newly created primitive
that is implemented by the method "methodname" of the Java class
"classname" that has the formal parameters "paramclass...".
Parameters to "::" must be strings.

    (:: "java.lang.System" "currentTimeMillis")

When invoking primitives created by "::" the first argument must be
a Java object of the primitive's method's class or nil for static methods:
invoke static method:

    (define ctm (:: "java.lang.System" "currentTimeMillis"))  
    (ctm nil)

invoke method on an object

    (define my-hash ((:: "java.util.HashMap" "new")))  
    (write ((:: "java.util.HashMap" "toString") my-hash))


## Known issues 

Murmel language:

- needs some means of catching and processing runtime errors,
  e.g. unwind-potect and handler-case
- file i/o

Compiler issues:

- define/ defun only work as top level forms, use as non-toplevel form
  will throw a "not-yet-implemented" compiler error.
- define-ing an already define-d symbol is not supported
- setq will throw a "not yet implemented" runtime error
- let* dynamic is not supported
