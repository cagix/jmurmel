Getting started
===============

To run your first Murmel program use these steps:

Make sure you have Java 8+ installed (Java 8 is minimum, Java 15 is preferred
as it is considerably faster). Entering `java -version` at a command prompt
should produce something like this:
(GNU/linux or Unix or Mac users please adjust as appropriate)

    C:\> java -version
    openjdk version "1.8.0_252"
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 1.8.0_252-b09)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 25.252-b09, mixed mode)

With `jmurmel-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the current directory start JMurmel
with the following command:

    C:\> java -jar jmurmel-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

At the REPL prompt enter e.g. `(write "Hello, World!")`, your screen should look like this:

    D:\robert\Workspace.java\platform\lambda\target>java -jar jmurmel-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    Enter a Murmel form or :command (or enter :h for command help or :q to exit):

    JMurmel> (write "Hello, World!")
    "Hello, World!"
    ==> t
    JMurmel>

You just wrote and ran a Murmel program! Now take it from there,
e.g. read README.md and/ or murmel-langref.lisp.
Or type :h at the REPL prompt.

(Don't read META.md, however.)
