# Contributing to JMurmel

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Here's some ideas on what/ how to contribute:

### Found a bug?
* Open a Github issue and make sure to include a sample input file
  as well as the output of `jmurmel --version`

### Found something confusing or wrong in murmel-langref.lisp?
* Feedback from Lisp-experts as well as non-Lispers is appreciated:
  open a Github issue with an explanation,
  ideally with a suggestion for improvement.

### Got a cool sample?
* IDK maybe open a Github issue and attach your cool Murmel file
  or open a PR?
