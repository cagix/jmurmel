Changes in JMurmel-1.2 relative to JMurmel-1.1

 * errormessages contain the filename and linenumber (was: only linenumber)
 * argument to sleep is "seconds" (was: internal-time-units-per-second),
   return value is nil (was: actually slept time in internal-time-units-per-second)
 * added more complete support for "let dynamic" and "let* dynamic"
   (before 1.2 only "let* dynamic" in interpreted code was supported)
 * added primitive functions assq, list*
 * added an optional parameter print-escape-p for primitive functions write, writeln, lnwrite
 * added special form "(declaim (optimize..."
 * added limited support for "macroexpand-1" in compiled code (quoted forms only)
 * [f]round, [f]floor, [f]ceiling and [f]truncate now support 1 or 2 arguments (was: 1)
 * compiled code now can invoke interpreted closures
 * added some benchmarks and found some speedups

 * mlib: added functions last, map-into, nconc,
   circular-list, compose, conjoin, disjoin, curry, rcurry,
   unzip, unzip-tails
 * mlib: inplace modification macros (incf, decf...) now process 1 or more args (was: 1 or 2)

 * backquote expansion generates more efficient code
 * some functions are "opencoded" (i.e. trampolines and/ or argcount checks are omitted,
   regular Java code is emitted instead)
 * fixed compiler primitive "list" to return a mutable list
 * fixed compiled "let*"
 * fixed "append" for compiled code
 * fixed using rplaca on varargs list
 * fixed/ cleaned up feature-flags
 * fixed search directory for load and require
